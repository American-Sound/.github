## GitHub Organization

American Sound has begun an initiative to open-source select utilities and technologies that we develop and use internally. These projects are shared intentionally and do not expose sensitive information or proprietary systems.

Our GitHub organization hosts a growing collection of repositories, including A/V control system plugins, Microsoft Azure DevOps scripts, programming templates, and related tools. Unless otherwise noted, projects are free to use under the terms of their respective licenses, which can be found in each repository’s LICENSE file. We welcome contributions in accordance with [our contribution guidelines](https://github.com/American-Sound/.github/blob/main/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md), unless a repository states otherwise.
